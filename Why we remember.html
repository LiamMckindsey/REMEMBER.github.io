<h1> Why should we remember?</h1>
</center>
<body>


<p>We as human being need to honor and have pride and the decency to remember and honor and be thankful for those who
 have fought to give up their life for our future. For us to live in this society where we have no fear of facing any
 economic crisis, fear of getting drafted to fight another war or living in fear of any upcoming war. Even if those veterans or
 wars we have to remember seems not so important to us since those thing are action and event in  the past. We must remember 
 that our life may not be as good or as prosperous as it is in our present time if it wasn't for those brave soul who fought and
 if it wasn't for them to be brave and risk their life for all the mission and battle in Europe, We would never be where we are as 
 a society. Those men and women were the one who gave us the good time and an era of peace and a long lasting prosperity to our 
 parent and ourself. And the least we can do for those people is to let those men and women to feel proud and to let them
 know that their action and bravery won't be forgotten. Even if at one point none of them are still there we must have the decency
 to remember them for their action that lead to where we are today and we can all agree the age we are living in is better then other 
 generation</p>
 
 <p>It is greatly important to remember and have a moment of silence for these wars. The reason why is because those soldiers from ww1, and ww2 fought risked their lived to protect our democracy; rights; and society. They made sure
 that the future generations like us live in a relatively free democratic nation. Free of fascist government, fear of our ideas and thoughts being censored.
 If we forget these soldiers, then their sacrifices and risks would be meaningless, we would discredit them. As if it never happened. If we do forget them and the wars, these astrocities may happen again. The same mistakes could be remade and the horrors of war relived. War is never glorious or justified. It is simply suffering, death and many astrocities.</p>
